# Changelog — LLL Library

## Batch 1 — Foundation Restructure (2026-05-02)

Reorganized the existing Table of Nations repo into the LLL Library multi-collection structure. No new content. The Table of Nations interactive itself is unchanged in behavior — same data, same filters, same visual design — but it now lives at a new path and pulls fonts/reset from a shared stylesheet.

### Repo & hosting

- GitHub repo renamed: `DoveLuvJR/table-of-nations` → `DoveLuvJR/lll-web` (manual rename via GitHub UI)
- Local repo cloned to `C:\Users\irwar\Documents\LLL-Web\`
- Vercel project unchanged; will continue auto-deploying from `main`. Live URL `table-of-nations.vercel.app` still resolves and now serves the new placeholder at root, with TON accessible at `/collections/table-of-nations/`

### Folder structure

### Table of Nations migration

- The original 28KB monolithic `index.html` (CSS + JS inline) was split into three files for maintainability:
  - `index.html` — semantic markup only
  - `styles.css` — TON-specific CSS (color palette, components, layout)
  - `app.js` — `N` data array + filter/render/share functions
- All 70 nation entries preserved exactly
- All TON-specific colors (`--gold`, `--j`, `--h`, `--s`, etc.) stayed in TON's stylesheet — not promoted to shared. Hashem's directive: don't over-extract; the next two collections will reveal what is actually shared.
- TON now imports `../../shared/styles.css` first for fonts + reset, then its own `./styles.css` for collection styling.

### Shared design tokens (conservative extraction)

Only three things were promoted to `shared/styles.css`:
1. Google Fonts import (Cinzel, EB Garamond, Inter)
2. CSS reset (`*{margin:0;padding:0;box-sizing:border-box}`)
3. Three font-family CSS variables: `--font-display`, `--font-body`, `--font-ui`

Colors, spacing, components — left alone. Premature sharing creates fake reuse.

### Vercel routing

- No `vercel.json` added. Vercel's default static-file routing serves `/collections/table-of-nations/` from the directory's `index.html` automatically. If the deploy reveals routing issues, a `vercel.json` will be added in a follow-up.

### Acceptance verification

- [x] Repo cloned to `C:\Users\irwar\Documents\LLL-Web\`
- [x] GitHub repo renamed to `DoveLuvJR/lll-web` (Hashem did this manually)
- [x] Folder structure matches spec
- [x] TON files moved to `collections/table-of-nations/`
- [x] Internal paths updated (relative `./` and `../../` references)
- [x] Shared CSS extracted conservatively (fonts, reset, font-family vars only)
- [x] Placeholder `index.html` and `about.html` created
- [x] Empty `shared/header.js` and `shared/footer.js` created
- [x] CHANGELOG.md created
- [x] DECISIONS.md created
- [x] Local verification — static server probe, all 6 paths returned 200 with matching byte counts
- [x] Push to `main` (commit `89b639a`), Vercel auto-deploy succeeded
- [x] Live URL verification — `https://table-of-nations.vercel.app/` serves placeholder, `/collections/table-of-nations/` serves TON, all asset paths resolve

### Carry-forward to Batch 2

- Real homepage with collections grid replaces the placeholder
- Real `about.html` content from LLL Manifesto + Drenchy Theme
- Wire up shared header / footer
- Decide on the LLL custom domain and convert from `table-of-nations.vercel.app`
